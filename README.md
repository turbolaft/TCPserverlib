# TCP Server Library

The TCP Server Library is a powerful and flexible library that allows you to easily create and manage TCP servers in your applications. It provides a simple and intuitive API for handling incoming connections, sending and receiving data, and managing server resources.

With the TCP Server Library, you can quickly build robust and scalable server applications that can handle multiple client connections concurrently. It abstracts away the complexities of low-level socket programming, allowing you to focus on implementing your server logic.

Key Features:
- Easy setup and configuration of TCP servers
- Support for handling multiple client connections
- Efficient data transmission and reception
- Customizable event-driven architecture
- Error handling and graceful shutdown

Whether you're building a chat server, a real-time data streaming application, or any other networked application that requires TCP communication, the TCP Server Library provides a solid foundation to get started quickly and efficiently.
